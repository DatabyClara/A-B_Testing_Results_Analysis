# A-B-Testing-Results-Analysis
The notebook where the project was developed can be found above **(Project_Sprint_09_en.ipynb)**. 

### Objective:
The goal of this project was to increase the revenue of an online store by prioritizing business hypotheses and analyzing the results of an A/B test.

### What Was Done:
1. Business hypotheses were prioritized using two frameworks: ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort).
2. An A/B test was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of changes based on selected hypotheses.
3. The test results were analyzed using several metrics, including cumulative revenue, average order size, and conversion rates. Both raw and filtered data (excluding outliers) were considered.

### Results:
The analysis provided insights into which group (A or B) performed better in terms of revenue and conversion. It highlighted the importance of filtering outliers for more accurate conclusions. These findings helped validate or discard certain hypotheses, guiding future business decisions.

### Tools and Languages Used:
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization

### Possible Improvements and Next Steps:
- Run additional A/B tests with more segmented user groups.
- Automate data preprocessing and analysis pipelines.
