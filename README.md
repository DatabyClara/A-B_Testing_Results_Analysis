# A-B-Testing-Results-Analysis
The notebook where the project was developed can be found in the link above **(Project_Sprint_09_en.ipynb)**. 

This project aimed to increase the revenue of an online store by **prioritizing hypotheses** using two different frameworks: *ICE* (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and *RICE* (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort). Given a CSV file containing various hypotheses that could solve identified problems and increase revenue, my task was to apply these frameworks to prioritize the most effective actions.

After identifying the most relevant hypotheses, an A/B test was conducted to compare the results of groups A and B. The analysis focused on several aspects to **extract insights** that could help achieve the goal of increasing revenue. The main aspects included:

- Cumulative revenue per group
- Average cumulative order size per group
- Relative difference in average cumulative order size for group B compared to group A
- Daily convertion rate for each group (ratio of orders to daily visits)
- Relative difference in cumulative conversion between groups A and B
- Compare several aspects using both raw data and filtered data (excluding outliers)
